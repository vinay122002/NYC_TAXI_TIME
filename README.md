# NYC_taxi_trip_time_prediction


This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating the duration of NYC taxi trips. The goal is to create a model that accurately predicts the time it takes for a taxi trip to be completed based on various factors such as pickup location, drop-off location, time of day, day of the week, and other relevant variables.

## Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to build a robust and reliable predictive model that can handle different time periods, varying traffic conditions, and other factors that impact the duration of a taxi trip. By accurately predicting trip durations, we aim to improve customer satisfaction, optimize resource allocation, and contribute to more efficient transportation planning in the city.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical records of NYC taxi trips, including information such as pickup and drop-off locations, timestamps, passenger count, trip distance, and trip duration. The dataset is sourced from [insert source] and includes data for a specific time period.

## Approach

1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing: In this phase, we will analyze the dataset, perform necessary data cleaning, handle missing values, and conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data.

2. Feature Engineering: We will engineer relevant features from the available dataset, such as extracting information from timestamps, deriving additional variables, and encoding categorical variables.

3. Model Development: We will train and evaluate
